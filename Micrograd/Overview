the Micrograd branch contains the code from the Andrej kaparthy video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ however it has my own notes and modifications to the code. 
It also containes snippets of code that were deleted after explanations in the video. 
If you dont want to bother with 2 hours of youtube or just want a quick refresher on the topic just delete the #s in the cells. 
I would highly recommend watching the video however.
